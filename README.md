### 📚 My Learning Path
I am starting from the ground up, focusing on a structured approach to data:
- **Fundamentals First:** I've mastered the core concepts of the data lifecycle, the 5-step analysis process, and the different types of analytics (Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive).
- **Data-Driven Mindset:** Learning to move beyond intuition to make decisions based on empirical evidence and patterns.
